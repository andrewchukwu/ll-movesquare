<!-- These marks are comments, it allows us to write comment on what a piece of code does.
Comments are very useful as it allows other people to understand what the computer
program is doing. Look out for these and see if you can understand how this computer
program works.

ABOUT THIS PROGRAM:
We will look at the very basic of a 2D game. Mathematics is very important in game programming as we have to
do a lot of calculations. This example, we have a square object on the screen and we will look at a simple
computer program that allows us to move the object around on the screen/canvas.
When playing games , you'll notice that the character cannot disappear off the screen - this requires
some mathematics to ensure that we can move the character to a place where we cannot see him.
